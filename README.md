# micro reddit
The micro reddit project was designed using the *Ruby on Rails* framework (version 7.0.4) and *Bootstrap 5*.
it allows a user to create an account or sign in with the use of the [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) gem.
Once signed in the user can simply create a post and see their post along with other user posts on the home page.

# Skills Demonstrated
During this project I have demonstrated my knowledge of Ruby on Rails *active record associations*, *scopes*, and *Ruby on Rails basics*, such as *validations*, *forms*, *migrations*, *MVC*, etc.
